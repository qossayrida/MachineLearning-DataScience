# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** provided by the State of Washington, accessible on [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The dataset contains information on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registered in Washington State. It includes 17 features per vehicle, such as VIN, county and city of registration, make, model, electric type, and electric range. This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effectively communicating insights.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:
1. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding features.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in electric vehicle adoption.
3. Provide visualizations and descriptive statistics that help interpret the data.
4. Document insights, findings, and any observed relationships among variables.

## Dataset Summary

- **Source:** Data.gov, Washington State Department of Licensing
- **Dataset Features:** 17 columns including vehicle VIN, registration city and county, make, model, electric type, and electric range
- **Vehicle Model Years:** 2013 to the current year
- **Data Type:** Real-world data on electric vehicles (EVs) registered in Washington state

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset required some preprocessing steps to ensure it was suitable for analysis:
1. **Missing Values**: Documented and handled missing values with strategies such as mean/median imputation and row removal.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Categorical features (e.g., Make, Model) were one-hot encoded for better compatibility with machine learning models.
3. **Normalization**: Numerical features were normalized to improve consistency in analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was performed to uncover trends and relationships within the data. Key analysis includes:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics for numerical features, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Spatial Distribution**: Visualizations of EV distribution across different locations (counties, cities).
- **Model Popularity**: Analysis of the popularity of different EV models.
- **Feature Correlations**: Investigation of relationships between numeric features.

## Visualization

Several visualizations were generated to interpret the dataset better:
1. **Histograms**: Distribution of numerical features.
2. **Scatter Plots**: Relationships between feature pairs.
3. **Boxplots**: Distribution of electric range across different vehicle types.
4. **Bar Charts**: Comparative visualizations of EVs across counties and cities.
